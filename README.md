# Average Calculator

A web based average calculator.

## Why?

I was taking  multiple measurements of a 3D printed part. I needed a way to get average result.
Yes, I could write down the numbers and add them  up then average them but why go through the
hassle? I looked around online, found a few web apps but was too complicated for my brain. So
now this exists!

## Bro, it looks ugly!

I know. Doesn't bother me, if it  bothers you, feel free to open a PR with some styling! Thanks!
